to erase some shit in massive:
 myVector.erase(myVector.begin() + *num*);



to add some shit in massive:
a.insert(a.begin()+*index*, *number*);



to find max and min shit in massive
auto maxElement = max_element(a.begin(), a.end());
auto minElement = min_element(a.begin(), a.end());
                  ||
                 \||/
                  \/
and this is to find the shit that called raznica between them:
int raznica = *maxElement - *minElement;



to Reverse some shit in massive:
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> a[i];
}
for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    cout << a[i] << " ";
}



to sort some shit in massive:
sort(integers.begin(), integers.end());



to find some shit in massive:
auto it = find(a.begin(),a.end(), m);


to erase some certain shit in massive:
myVector.erase(myVector.begin() + min(k, m), myVector.begin() + max(k, m) + 1); 


to count some shit with if in massive:
int countEven = count_if(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), [](int x) { return x % 2 == 0; });


to just count some shit:
int countTwo = count(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), 2);


to transform some shit like to swuare or squareroot some shit in massive:
transform(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), std::back_inserter(squaredNumbers), [](int x) { return x * x; });


to just sum some shit:
int sum = accumulate(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), 0);


to find some shit in massive with fucking index:
cin >> n;
    auto it = find(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), n);

    if (it != numbers.end()) {
        cout << "Value "<< n <<" found at index: " << distance(numbers.begin(), it) << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Value 3 not found in the vector." << endl;
    }
